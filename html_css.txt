Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
<span> , <input> , <img>


Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
<p> , <div> , <h1 -- h6>
-------------------------

<meta> tag (inside head)
specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)


Pading: space between content and border of an element.
Margin: space outside the border of an element.

--------------------------
selectors : CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Combinators : A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Pseudo Classes :  pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
ex = :active,:checked,:disabled,:link,:visited,:hover,:focus

Pseudo Elements :Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element.
::after, ::before

Attribute selector:
input[type="text"] { color: red; }
---------------------------------------

Specificity is a set of rules applied by browsers to determine which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules could apply to the same element. 
Specificity is usually calculated based on the types of selectors used in the rule.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before

Start at 0, add 100 for each ID value, add 10 for each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), add 1 for each element selector or pseudo-element.
