JS
Js is interpreted programming language.
Js used for client side scripting as well as server side scripting.
JavaScript is dynamically typed.
This means the type of objects is checked during run-time. (In a statically typed language, the type is checked during compile-time.)

How js works:
first received by the js engine then inside js engine parser is used to check code for
syntatic
errors in line by line manner.
After no error in code it creates the data structure called AST(Abstract
Syntax
Tree)
Then js engine convert the js code into machine code. Last byte code get executed

window is the first thing that gets loaded in the browser. The document object is page that will be loaded into
    the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside window object.
window properties are:- document, history, screen, navigator, location

    window object is used to display popup dialog box(alert,confirm,prompt,open,close)
    history object is used to switch to history pages(back,forward,go(number))


Advantages of JS
    It separate html and code.
    Cached js files can speed up page loads.
    lightweight and interpreted programming language.
    open and cross platform programming language.
    Dynamically typed language : variable changes type dynamically.


Variable
    var: Global Scope, updated and redeclare
    let: Blocked scope, updated but not redeclare
    const: Blocked scope, not updated and not redeclare


Data Types
Primitive: store only single value
string:"str"
number:123
undefined:undefined
boolean:true,false
null:null,Null
symbol:unique identifier used to store an anonymous and unique value 
Non Primitive: store multiple value
object: collection of data(array,date,object)

falsy values:
undefined
null
NAN
''
false
0
-0
0n

Difference between rest and spread:
Rest parameter is used to take variable number of arguments and turns into an array while Spread
operator takes an array or an object and spreads it.
Rest parameter is used in function declaration whereas Spread operator is used in function call



Arrow function : It can only be used as a function expression
var add = (a,b) => a+b;
var mul = (a) => a*2;


Javascript Hoisting : It is js default behavior of moving declarations to the top. Always declare
    variables at the beginning of every scope

Closure: It is an inner function. It can access the outer veriable of function. To use closure simply
    define function inside another function and expose it.

Anonymous function: without having any name and wont do anything on their own. These are generally use
    along with  an event handler

Js Callback: function passed to some method as a argument or option. It is a function that is to be
    executed after another function has finished executing

Promise
A promise is an object that may produce value in the future.A promise is always in one of the possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

Strict mode allows you to set your program to operate in a strict context.


Slice: return the selected element in array as a new array object.It doesn't change the original array

Splice: return the removed items in an array.It changes the original array



JSON.parse():convert json string to js object
JSON.stringify() : convert js object to json string



ES6 Features:

    let and const keywords,
    Arrow Functions : ()=>({}),
    Template Literals : `${}`,
    Destructuring (arr,obj),
    Multi line string : `String`
    Promises,
    Modules (import,export),


.attr( "checked" ): checked 
    .prop( "checked" ): true 
    .is( ":checked" ): true 

    
Cookies are data stored in small files on computer.
create = document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
read = document.cookie
delete = change value of expires
update = same as create



generator function
function* simpleGenerator(){
yeild 1
yeild 2
yeild 3
}

const generatorObject = simpleGenerator()
console.log(generatorObject.next()) // value: 1,done: false
console.log(generatorObject.next()) // value: 2,done: false
        

You get a negative infinity if you divide a negative number with zero in JavaScript.
console.log(-10/0)  - -Infinity

Implicit type coercion means a value is converted from one type to another under the hood
var x = 1;
var y = "2";

x + y // Returns "12"
----------------------------------------------
var x = 10;
var y = "10";

x - y // Returns 0


Local storage — stores data for the client without an expiration date.
Session storage — stores data for only one session. The data is gone when the browser is closed.

The eval() function evaluates code inside a string.
console.log(eval("5+10"));

In event bubbling an event starts by running the event handlers on the innermost element. Then it triggers the parents’ event handlers until it reaches the outermost element.

event delegation is the technique, bubbling is what the event itself does, and capturing is a way of using event delgation on events that don't bubble.

--------------------------------------------
Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.
var form = document.querySelector('#hogwarts-application');

// Listen for changes to fields inside the form
form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {

	// Log the field that was changed
	console.log(event.target);

}, false);

or

window.addEventListener('click', e => {
  if (e.target.className === 'btn') console.log('Hello there!');
});
--------------------------------------
event bubbling
<div onclick="show()">
	a
	<div onclick="show1()">
		b
		<div onclick="show2()">
			c
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
function show(){
console.log(1)
}
function show1(){
console.log(2)
}
function show2(){
console.log(3)
}
You can stop bubbling by event.stopPropagation
--------------------------------------
Capturing is the exact opposite of bubbling, meaning that the outer event handlers are fired before the most specific handler (i.e. the one on the button). Note that all capturing event handlers are run first, then all the bubbling event handlers.
You can use event capturing by applying a third argument to EventTarget.addEventListener, setting it to true. For example:
// Capture phase
ancestors.forEach(a => {
  a.addEventListener('click', e => {
    console.log(`Hello from ${e.currentTarget}`);
  }, true);
});
---------------------------------------
Debounce vs. Throttle. 
The major difference between debouncing and throttling is that debounce calls a function when a user hasn't carried out an event in a specific amount of time, 
while throttle calls a function at intervals of a specified amount of time while the user is carrying out an event

Event capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM. 
The event capturing occurs followed by event bubbling.

Checking that a string contains a substring

const string = “foo”
const substring = “oo”
string.includes(substring)
<< true


string.indexOf(substring) !== -1
<< true
