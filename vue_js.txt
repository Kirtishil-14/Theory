Vue js - framework (version 3)

prop component = data is passed from parent component to child component using component prop

Reactivity â€“ When you change the data value, the page is updated to reflect the changes. Data properties and computed properties in Vue are reactive. Vue.js services are not reactive.

lifecycle hooks -
Before Create - This is the first lifecycle hook that is called when a Vue instance has been created.
Created - It's called immediately after the 'Before creates' hook, but the Vue instance has already set initial properties, data, etc.
Before mount - invoked right before the instance is mounted on the DOM. The template has been completed at this time.
Mounted - This is the name given to the template once it has been filled with data and is fully functional.
Before Updated - When any changes to data require the DOM to be changed, this method is called before the update.
Updated - It's called after the DOM has been updated.
Before destroy - It's a location where you can clean up your resources before terminating the Vue instance.
Destroyed - When all Vue instances have been destroyed, this method is called. When you call the destruct method on an object in code, it will be activated.

v-if = remove element/block from DOM
v-show = show/hide using css

Mixins are a versatile approach to sharing reusable Vue component functionality.

In one-way data flow the view(UI) part of application does not updates automatically when data Model is change we need to write some custom code to make it updated every time a data model is changed.
In Vue js v-bind is used for one-way data flow or binding.

In two-way data binding the view(UI) part of application automatically updates when data Model is changed.
In Vue.js v-model directive is used for two way data binding.
