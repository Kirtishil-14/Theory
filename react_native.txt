React Native (version = .67)
Mobile Development
Native uses its API to render code for mobile applications.

Why react native is better than others?
React Native is a platform that allows you to build native apps for iOS and Android.
It uses native components instead of using web components as building blocks. 
It targets mobile platforms rather than the browser. Its purpose is to learn once and write anywhere.


Core components: 
- Text : <p></p>
- View: <div></div>
- Image: <img />
- ScrollView : <div "overflow"></div>
- TextInput: <input type="text"/>

FlatList : 
only renders elements that are currently showing on the screen, not all the elements at once
requires two props:
1. data: array of objects
2. renderItem: function that returns a JSX element
<FlatList
    data={[
      {key: 'Devin'},
      {key: 'Dan'},
      {key: 'Dominic'},
      {key: 'Jackson'},
      {key: 'James'},
      {key: 'Joel'},
      {key: 'John'},
      {key: 'Jillian'},
      {key: 'Jimmy'},
      {key: 'Julie'},
    ]}
    renderItem={({item}) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item.key}</Text>}
  />

SectionList :
data broken into logical sections, maybe with section headers
<SectionList
    sections={[
      {title: 'D', data: ['Devin', 'Dan', 'Dominic']},
      {title: 'J', data: ['Jackson', 'James', 'Jillian', 'Jimmy', 'Joel', 'John', 'Julie']},
    ]}
    renderItem={({item}) => <Text style={styles.item}>{item}</Text>}
    renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <Text style={styles.sectionHeader}>{section.title}</Text>}
    keyExtractor={(item, index) => `basicListEntry-${item.title}`}
 />

TouchableHighlight :
The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.

TouchableNativeFeedback :
display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch

TouchableOpacity :
provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.

TouchableWithoutFeedback :
If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed

Pure Component
it renders a similar output for a similar state and props

Hot Reloading
It only refreshes the files that were changed without losing the state of the app.
It displays the code changes according to new code changes without restarting the app from start.

Live Reloading
It reloads or refreshes the entire app when a file changes.
It requires the restart of the app in case of any change in the code

Threads: We can control a single sequential flow within a program using a thread in React Native
React Native right now uses 3 threads:
-MAIN/UI  Thread — This is the main application thread on which your Android/iOS app is running.The only thread that can manipulate host views. 
The UI of the application can be changed by the Main thread and it has access to it .
-Shadow Thread — layout created using React library in React Native can be calculated by this and it is a background thread.
-JavaScript Thread — The main Javascript code is executed by this thread.It is a thread where our business logic will run. 
It means JS thread is a place where our JavaScript code is executed.


Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps write applications that run in different environments. 
This means the entire data flow of the app is handled within a single container while persisting previous state.

Actions: are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. 
This means if any state change is necessary the change required will be dispatched through the actions.

Reducers: “Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don’t specify how the application’s state changes in response. 
This is the job of reducers.” when an action is dispatched for state change its the reducers duty to make the necessary changes to the 
state and return the new state of the application.

Store: a store can be created with help of reducers which holds the entire state of the application. 
The recommended way is to use a single store for the entire application rather than having multiple stores 
which will violate the use of redux which only has a single store.


Enable Hermes Engine: Enable Hermes JavaScript engine in your React Native app to improve JavaScript performance, reduce app startup time, and decrease memory usage, especially on Android devices.
